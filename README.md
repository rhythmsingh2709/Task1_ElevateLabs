# Task 1 â€” Port Scanning & Network Reconnaissance

This repository contains my work for **Task 1 of the Cyber Security Internship**.  
The objective was to use **Nmap** to scan the local network, discover active hosts, identify open ports, and analyze exposed services. This helps understand how network reconnaissance is performed and what risks open ports pose.
